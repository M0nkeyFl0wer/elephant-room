            <div class="chronicle-content">
                <p>A city planner once called us with a problem: <strong>"We need to create a climate action plan, but no one shows up to our meetings. And when they do, it's just the usual suspects yelling at each other. How do we actually hear from people? More importantly - how do we get them to stop fighting and start solving?"</strong></p>
                
                <p>They weren't alone. From Indigenous Nations navigating energy transitions…to utilities like Sydney Water (Australia) trying to convince residents that yes, they really would need to drink recycled water…to neighborhood groups getting doors slammed in their faces when proposing energy retrofits…we kept seeing the same story.</p>
                
                <p>Officials needed better data. Communities wanted real agency. And everyone just wanted to feel invited to the conversation…not lectured at. So we threw out the old playbook.</p>
                
                <p>We became conversation architects, designing engagements where communities had their say and their say became policy.</p>
                
                <div class="challenge">
                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Making data stop feeling like homework</li>
                        <li>Turning conflict into collaboration</li>
                        <li>Creating plans with real world impact, not just shelf life</li>
                        <li>Helping neighbourhoods with collective action</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="solution">
                    <h4>Meeting the Challenge</h4>
                    <p>We transform dense IPCC reports into interactive dashboards where communities create their own climate action plans using a familiar budgeting tool. Instead of top-down mandates, people decide which emissions cuts work best for their communities; balancing feasibility, cost, and local priorities.</p>
                    
                    <p>For example, a rural town might prioritize farmland solar over bike lanes, while a dense city could focus on transit upgrades instead of individual EV rebates. The tool also helps test incentives (carrots versus sticks) and gives people the ability to, alongside their neighbours, tell 'city hall' how they'd like to drive change.</p>
                    
                    <p>In our Cool Neighbourhoods project, homeowners joined together to work on ways to both lower their GHG emissions and create more resilient neighborhoods.</p>

                <div class="results">

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tailored, community-backed plans</strong> - A rural town prioritized farmland solar, while a dense city invested in transit over EV rebates.</li>
                        <li><strong>From arguing to collaborating</strong> - Residents tested policy ideas (carrots vs. sticks) and collectively shaped solutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plans that stuck</strong> - Because people helped design them, implementation rates soared.</li>

                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                    <p>Most homeowners wanted to cut emissions but didn't know where to start; or found the process overwhelming, expensive, or just plain boring.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="solution">
                    <h4>Our Approach</h4>
                    <p>We made it social, simple, and fun. Neighbourhoods hosted dinners, potlucks, and thermal imaging events (with help from local fire departments) where they saw real-time heat leaks in their homes and learned how to fix them. Residents shared volunteer contractors. We arranged for group discounts on heat pumps, windows, solar panels and electric motors. And neighbourhoods became more resilient and less energy intensive.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>27+ neighbourhoods engaged</strong> - From one pilot in West Vancouver to a network stretching across the North Shore, Bowen Island and Squamish, B.C.</li>
                        <li><strong>520+ households taking action</strong> - Homes became more energy efficient and resilient to heatwaves and weather events.</li>
                        <li><strong>8,257 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions cuts</strong> - Proving small steps add up.</li>

                    <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                    <p>Remote Indigenous communities relied on expensive, polluting diesel generators. Transitioning to renewables was possible but only if led by the communities themselves.</p>

                    <h4>Our Approach</h4>
                    <p>We supported Nation-designed plans that integrated clean energy with housing, transport, and cultural priorities. Example: The Heiltsuk Climate Action Team created plans for everything from community transportation to home heating and marine electrification; all with the goal in mind of training local crews and exporting their 'lessons learned' to other communities.</p>

                        <li>Haíɫzaqv created their own plan to reach the community's goals.</li>
                        <li>Alongside costs and greenhouse gas emissions reduction, we scored each proposed solution for difficulty, jobs created, wellbeing, community support, risk and innovation.</li>
                        <li>A blueprint for Indigenous-led transitions was created to be emulated by other Nations across Canada.</li>

                <p>The pattern was impossible to ignore: A crisis would erupt. Outrage would flare. Then—nothing. Politicians would defer. Corporations would calculate. And the window for action would vanish.</p>
                
                <p>But in that gap between "someone should" and "someone did," we saw our role: Build the tools, coalitions, and pressure to force change when institutions won't.</p>

                    <p>When Kinder Morgan's pipeline threatened BC's coast, we founded Tanker Free BC, mobilizing legal challenges, shareholder campaigns, and grassroots actions that delayed construction for a decade. <strong>Result: 56 million tonnes of annual emissions prevented.</strong></p>
                    
                    <blockquote>"We'll never forget the local fisherman who showed up to a Kinder Morgan townhall with his grandkids and said, 'I'm not here for me - explain this to the children.'"</blockquote>
                    
                    <p>For VoteClimate, we turned voter apathy into electoral consequences, flooding swing districts with so many messages on billboards, buses, trains, elevators, newspapers, TV's and computers, politicians couldn't escape…especially when the letters started coming in like letters to Santa.</p>

                    <p>The Raven Coal Mine was a done deal, until we exposed its risks. <strong>Result: Permits revoked. 440K tonnes of yearly coal left in the ground.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>At Thor Chemicals, our investigations triggered mercury testing that forced a UN intervention. <strong>Result: Site shuttered. 8,000+ workers protected.</strong></p>

                    <p>CRED didn't lobby corporations; we made climate leadership from corporations the thing, recruiting 300+ businesses to advocate for policies they'd once ignored.</p>
                    
                    <p>Disability Without Poverty transformed abstract policy debates into human stories that donors and ministers couldn't ignore.</p>
